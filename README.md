.emacs.d
========

Work-in-progress emacs configed cobbled together from various sources around the web.  Trying to rely mostly on melpa/marmalade for now.

Notes
-----

* Uses manually provided python-mode.el; currently assumes python-mode.el-6.1.1
* Uses [Jedi](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi) for python interaction
